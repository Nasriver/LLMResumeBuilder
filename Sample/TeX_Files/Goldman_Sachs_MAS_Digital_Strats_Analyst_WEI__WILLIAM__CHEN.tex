\cvsection{Professional Experience}
\cventry{Proton Capital Management}{United States}{Quantitative Research Intern}{June 2025 -- September 2025}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a systematic fixed income screening workflow using yield spread analytics across 500+ instruments, translating relative-value signals into actionable candidates for portfolio construction and research prioritization.
\item Built a Python scenario engine for interest-rate risk analytics, attributing DV01 and convexity under parallel shifts, twists, and butterfly moves to support resilient portfolio management decisions.
\item Automated daily risk reporting by aggregating Greeks across the book into a repeatable pipeline, reducing manual turnaround time by 60\% while eliminating recurring reconciliation breaks.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1ex}

\cventry{General Life Insurance}{Hong Kong}{Actuarial Analyst}{January 2023 -- September 2024}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed an experience study pipeline on 200K+ policy records to quantify lapse and mortality dynamics, producing data-driven assumption updates supporting IFRS 17 reserving and business stakeholder reviews.
\item Automated model validation workflows in Python to replace manual Excel processes, improving operational scalability and cutting the quarterly reporting cycle time by 40\% with clearer auditability.
\item Built scenario projection models for new product launches, quantifying capital requirements and embedded value sensitivity under stress assumptions to inform risk-aware planning and pricing decisions.
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Projects}
\textbf{Automated Earnings Call Sentiment and Return Prediction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fine-tuned FinBERT on 5,000+ earnings call transcripts and operationalized sentiment classification with 84\% test accuracy, creating an ML layer suitable for scalable client-facing research workflows.
\item Engineered cross-sectional signals from sentence-level tone and validated event-window performance, generating statistically significant 3-day abnormal returns of 1.8\% in the top-quintile portfolio.
\item Built an automated data ingestion and parsing pipeline using SEC EDGAR API and spaCy, reducing end-to-end processing time from hours to under 10 minutes per quarter.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1ex}

\textbf{Fixed Income Relative Value and Curve Trading Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented a PCA-based yield curve decomposition into level, slope, and curvature factors, using residual-based analytics to surface relative-value opportunities across 2s5s10s and butterfly expressions.
\item Backtested carry-and-rolldown strategies in US Treasury and swap markets (2015--2024), achieving Sharpe 0.72 gross with max drawdown of $-6.3\%$ over the full sample period.
\item Added DV01-neutral position sizing and disciplined risk controls, improving risk-adjusted returns by 25\% versus equal-weight allocation while reducing whipsaw trades by 35\% using z-score filters.
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Competitions}
\textbf{Morgan Stanley Quant Finance Challenge 2024 (Top 10 Finalist)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a dynamic delta-vega hedging framework for a structured equity product under stochastic volatility, minimizing P\&L variance across 10,000 Monte Carlo paths with robust scenario evaluation.
\item Designed a portfolio stress testing workflow across 8 macro scenarios, including rate shocks, credit spread widening, and equity drawdowns, to communicate resilience and key risk drivers clearly.
\end{itemize}

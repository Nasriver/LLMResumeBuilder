\cvsection{Professional Experience}
\cventry{Vertex Capital Management}{United States}{Quantitative Research Intern}{June 2025 -- September 2025}
\begin{itemize}
\item Built a data-quality pipeline to clean high-frequency option quotes, detecting anomalous prints and ensuring consistent time series inputs for systematic backtesting and downstream risk analytics.
\item Engineered an OOP Python backtesting framework to evaluate option strategies across large parameter grids and market regimes, supporting scalable experimentation, performance attribution, and reproducible research workflows.
\item Monitored and decomposed daily PnL by strategy and risk drivers, producing diagnostics aligned with greeks-based explanations to guide iterative remediation of model and data issues.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1ex}

\cventry{Pacific Life Insurance}{Hong Kong}{Actuarial Analyst}{January 2023 -- September 2024}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed automated pricing tools in VBA to run multi-scenario profitability analysis, improving evaluation efficiency by 50\% while strengthening controls, documentation, and repeatability of production reporting.
\item Applied sensitivity and scenario analysis to quantify impacts of new rider features, translating assumptions into decision-ready risk tradeoffs that supported launch recommendations and improved ROE by 10\%.
\item Analyzed 100K+ historical claim records to recalibrate pricing assumptions, emphasizing data cleaning, statistical validation, and segmentation to improve stability and accuracy of group health valuations.
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Projects}
\textbf{Voice-Based AI Financial Discord Chatbot}
\begin{itemize}
\item Architected an end-to-end voice assistant integrating speech-to-text, local LLM inference, tool-calling, and streaming text-to-speech, forming an API-driven pipeline to retrieve and process financial information reliably.
\item Deployed a local Qwen-8B model with an MCP tool interface, using prompt design and deterministic function calls to reduce hallucination risk and improve consistency of structured outputs.
\item Implemented a low-latency audio stack with Librosa, VAD, and Fast-Whisper plus CUDA-accelerated TTS streaming, optimizing responsiveness for real-time interactive analytics and query workflows.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1ex}

\textbf{Implied Volatility Surface Modelling in Crypto Options}
\begin{itemize}
\item Built an end-to-end time series analytics workflow on Deribit BTC/ETH options (2019--2025), inferring forwards, extracting implied volatilities, and calibrating surfaces across maturities for consistent market data inputs.
\item Implemented a nanosecond-level implied volatility solver in Rust using the J\"ackel framework, achieving 140ns runtime and 20\% speed improvement while maintaining $<5\times10^{-9}$ error.
\item Calibrated arbitrage-free SSVI, SVI, and B-spline surfaces with constrained optimization and regularization, improving robustness under sparse strikes and illiquid conditions typical of noisy market time series.
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Competitions}
\textbf{Annual IAQF Academic Affiliate Membership Student Competition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a 30-day Single-Stock VIX (SSVIX) measure using additional maturities, improving volatility time series quality and reliability when near- and next-term options are illiquid.
\item Integrated SSVIX for the top 50 S\&P 500 constituents to enhance index implied correlation modeling, supporting more theoretically grounded diagnostics for correlation and crash risk.
\item Simulated volatility spillovers and market-shock impacts using a one-factor Student-t EGARCH model and Constant Conditional Correlation framework, evaluating model behavior under stress scenarios.
\end{itemize}
